        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> My name is Karl Bergl√∂f and i am currently studying front-end development at Nackademin.
            I have always been a creative person. Ever since i was a kid ive been interested with colors,
            shapes and beautiful lines. on my spare time i like to draw and create, front-end seemed like a really good way to
            further evolve my interests. To create a good-looking website togheter with HTML, CSS and Javascript
            is a very rewarding and interesting process. I constantly learn new things and i'm driven by development.
